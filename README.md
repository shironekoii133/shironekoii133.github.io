# About me
I spent 19 years of my life in Hanoi before I moved to Sapporo, Hokkaido for college. Currently a sophomore at Hokkaido University, majoring in Japanese Political Economy. My main interest involves reading, listening to all sort of music during commuting time and making sweet desserts once in a while.
